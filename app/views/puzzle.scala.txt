The year is 2157. Bacteria of unknown origin threaten humanity with devastating pandemics never before seen. The bacteria are resistant to all known antibiotics. An NCATS scientist by the name of Lothar, with background in mathematics, discovers a new drug modality that can stop the bacteria. This new modality, through an ingenious encoding technique, strategically modifies key amino acid residues of a beta-defensin peptide so as to not only maximize potency and selectivity but also allow the drug to work synergistically with the body's immune system. There are 18 modified residues in the peptide:

Can you recover the original 18-residue sequence? In the moment that leads to his discovery, Dr. Lothar proclaims "all roads must lead to Rome" and proceeds to list some of the modified residue sequences derived from the decoding algorithm.
