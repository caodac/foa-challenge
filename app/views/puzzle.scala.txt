In a far-distant future, bacteria of unknown origin threaten humanity with devastating pandemics never before seen. The bacteria are resistant to all known antibiotics. An NCATS scientist by the name of Lothar, with background in mathematics, discovers a new drug modality that can stop the bacteria. This new modality, through an ingenious encoding technique, strategically modifies key amino acid residues of a beta-defensin peptide so as to allow the drug to work synergistically with the body's immune system. There are 18 modified residues in the following peptide.

In order for the peptide to act synergistically (i.e., achieve target recognition), these modified 18 residues must be transcribed in a specific order. In the moment that leads to his discovery, Dr. Lothar proclaims "all roads must lead to Rome" and proceeds to transcribe the peptide into possible sequences for target recognition.

Can you identify the required 18-residue sequence for target recognition in this peptide?
