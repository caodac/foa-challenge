Beta-defensins are antimicrobial peptides that help prevent infections. An NCATS scientist by the name of Lothar, with a background in mathematics, has discovered how the strategic substitution of key amino acid residues of a beta-defensin peptide allows the peptide to target specific bacteria. To demonstrate this, he substituted 18 residues to produce the following peptide.

In order for the peptide to work, the set of substituted residues (i.e., a ‘recognition signature’) must be recognized in a specific order, starting at specific positions, throughout the peptide. In the moment that leads to his discovery, Lothar conjectures "all roads must lead to Rome" and proceeds to resolve how the peptide presents different possible recognition signatures, beginning from different peptide residues.

Can you identify the recognition signature of 18 residues necessary for target recognition by this peptide?
