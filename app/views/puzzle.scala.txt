Beta-defensins are antimicrobial peptides that help prevent infections. An NCATS scientist by the name of Lothar, with background in mathematics, has discovered how the strategic modification of key amino acid residues of a beta-defensin peptide allow the peptide to target specific bacteria. To demonstrate this, he modified 18 residues to produce the following peptide.

In order for the peptide to work, the modified residues (a ‘recognition sequence’) must be introduced into specific positions in the peptide. In the moment that leads to his discovery, Dr. Lothar proclaims "all roads must lead to Rome" and proceeds to resolve how the peptide presents different possible recognition sequences, beginning from different peptide residues.

Can you identify the recognition sequence of 18 residues necessary for target recognition in this peptide?
