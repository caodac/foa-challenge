      <p>
      The aim of this challenge is to download and run the Python notebook available
        <a href="@routes.Assets.versioned("notebooks/Challenge3.ipynb")">here</a>. This will require
      you to setup a <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> environment, install any required Python packages and
        fix the code so that it runs.
        </p>
      <p>If you're succcessful there should be no errors and an HTTP 200 status code. You will progress to the next stage
