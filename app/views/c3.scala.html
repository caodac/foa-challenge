      <br><br>Since the project will involve working with some pre-existing
      code, this stage will test your patience with some one else's code.

      <br><br>The aim of this task is to download and run the Python
      notebook available
      <a href='@{controllers.routes.ChallengeController.stage(part.id.toString,3) + "?action=notebook"}'>here</a>.
      This will require you to setup a <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>
      environment, install any required Python packages and fix the code
      so that it runs.

      <br><br>If you're succcessful there should be no errors and an
      HTTP <code>200</code>
      status code. You can progress to the next stage of the challenge by
      reloading this URL or clicking on the button below, after you have
      sucessfully run the notebook.
