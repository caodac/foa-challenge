        Welcome to the NCATS Translator Challenge! This is a unique URL that you may wish to share with fellow team members. There are 6 challenges to be completed.  Each challenge should take anywhere from minutes, to over an hour to complete. Challenges must be complete in sequence.  If you leave the site before completing all of the challenges, you will return where you left off.  However, for challenges that have multiple components, leaving the site prior to completing all components may result in loss of your entries and require you to re-enter the information upon returning to the site.
 
        <br><br>We will not be able to provide additional hints for the challenges.  Upon successful completion of a challenge, you will see a screen indicating your success and you will be provided with access to a portion of the FOA.  If you provide an incorrect answer, the screen will indicate it is incorrect and you may try again.  There is no limit to the number of times you may try to answer the question.
 
        <br><br>Good luck!
