        We do not understand how all approved drugs
        work, but for a majority of them we can construct a clinical outcome
        pathway that explains the molecular pathophysiology of their action.
        A clinical outcome pathway can be thought of as the efficacy
        equivalent of an adverse outcome pathway; it explains how a
        molecular initiating event precipitates a series of key events which
        manifest as a clinical outcome, beginning with (1) a molecular
        initiating event physically interacting with (2) a biological target,
        which affects (3) a biological pathway or series of pathways that are
        relevant to (4) a particular cell type or tissue that manifest as (5)
        a clinical phenotype or endpoint which together reflect (6) a disease
        or condition. 
        
        <br><br>For the drug-disease pair listed below, construct a
        clinical outcome pathway that best explains how the drug effects its
        action.  Please enter the PMID of a paper which is tagged with the relevant
        MeSH term for each of the categories below in order to construct the COP.
          The same paper may be used for multiple categories.
