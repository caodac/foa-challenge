        We do not understand how all approved drugs
        work, but for a majority of them we can construct a clinical outcome
        pathway that explains the molecular pathophysiology of their action.
        A clinical outcome pathway can be thought of as the efficacy
        equivalent of an adverse outcome pathway; it explains how a
        molecular initiating event precipitates a series of key events which
        manifest as a clinical outcome, beginning with (1) a molecular
        initiating event physically interacting with (2) a biological target,
        which affects (3) a biological pathway or series of pathways that are
        relevant to (4) a particular cell type or tissue that manifest as (5)
        a clinical phenotype or endpoint which together reflect (6) a disease
        or condition. 
        
        <br><br>For each of the drug-disease pairs listed below, construct a
        clinical outcome pathway that best explains how the drug effects its
        action.  Please also provide a confidence for each clinical outcome
        pathway assertion.  Please report “clinical outcome pathway is not
        understood” in cases where the pathophysiology is not known in the
        literature and also provide a confidence for this assertion.  For
        each element of a clinical outcome pathway, resolve the relevant
        entity to an existing dictionary ID/ontology term.
