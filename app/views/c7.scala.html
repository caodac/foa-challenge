        <i>So many associations to test, so little money ...</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        By amassing a team of motivated graduate students and a lot of coffee, a group has
        amassed a rich dataset of 1,000,000 gene-disease associations, each one quantified by a
        <i>knowledge score</i>. These scores represent
        the knowlege available about the gene and disease&mdash;smaller values
        indicate that less is known about the gene and disease, and conversely, larger values indicate
        that the gene-disease association is well studied.
        
        The data is available
        <a href="@routes.Assets.versioned("resources/gene-disease.csv.gz")">here</a> and
        lists the gene, disease it is associated with and the knowledge score.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the group is looking for funding to explore a subset of these associations. But they
        don't want to study what everybody else is studying, so the group is
        interested in identifying the subset of associations such that
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>the selected associations include every gene and every disease from the
          original dataset (there may be repetitions of a gene or disease), and</li>
        <li>the sum of the knowledge scores of the selected associations is minimized (correct to the second decimal place)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This means the subset so identified, will represent those associations which, in aggregate, 
        have very little known about them. Can you help them? Your answer should be a CSV file
        in the form
      </p>
      <pre>
        "Gene","Disease","Score"
        "G1","D1",SCORE</pre>
      <p>where the first line is the header, and then each row is an association between a gene
        and a disease and the given score. Note that all text fields should be quoted
        using double quotes.
      </p>
